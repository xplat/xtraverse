performance test with ReadDoc 18

code changes

* strictness annotations with $!! (rwnf) in XML parser
  at mkElement, mkAttr, mkText, ...

results

* runtime remains as it was
* total space alloc remains as it was
* BUT: maximum space for Strings reduces
  from about 380Mb to 280Mb
* test with native HTML parser results in
  a total of about 120Mb space, this is the expected
  size
* the time is spend in parsec with both parsers
* the total time for HTML is 8.64 for XML 19.86

problems

* the parsec (2.1) XML parser has a space leak,
  the parsec HTML parser with striktness annotations works fine
