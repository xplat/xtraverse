profiling with GenDoc 18

code changes

* quoting of XML/HTML chars no longer done
  in an extra tree traversal in escapeDoc
  but moved into showXmlTrees

results

* conversion from string into blob
  uses 25% of the time and 42% of space,
  no further optimization during output seems to be neccesary
